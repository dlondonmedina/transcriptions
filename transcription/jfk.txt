gemma ladies and gentlemen i appreciate very much your generous invitation be denied you bear a heavy responsibilities these days and a year on until i read that some time ago reminded me about particularly evelyn the burdens of present day event there are on your profession you remember may remember that in eighteen thirty one new york herald tribune and of the sponsorship and publishing of heart really employees of london carter on them with you and your list by the name of the hallmarks we withdraw that far apart on the market stone broke in with a family ayo in an arched costly view to really been managing editor ousting him for an increase in the universe and salary of five dollars per inch mom this hour in which he mingles on gratefully label as lousy as petty bourgeois cheating by one all his financial videos were refused to march looked around for a means of livelihood and saying eventually terminating his relationship with the tribune and a voting is now on full time to the cause to bequeath of the world the seeds of leninism stalinism revolution and the cold war the following is capitalistic new york newsday but it heighth andrea more primary up if only mock should remain a foreign car spawn of history might have been different and night why halt halt publishes will bear this lesson in mind when next guy may receive a poverty stricken appeal from a small increase the expense account of it's purer newspaperman why have i selected as a tyler my remarks tonight the president of the press some ac guess that this would be more naturally we're in a president versus the press but those i'm not my sentiments tonight is to allow about that when a well-known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our state department repudiate shared newspaper attacks on his colleague it was unnecessary for ross to reply that this administration was not responsible for the press for the press had already made it clear that it was not responsible for this administration hummel asked my privacy and i'd is not to deliver the usual assault on the so called one body crashed on the contrary in recent months i've rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press except from a few republicans what the arsenide purpose tonight to disguise on this and that televising of presidential press conferences i think it is highly beneficial to have some twenty million americans regularly sit in on these conferences to verify may say so the incisive the intelligent and the curious qualities display by your washing cars bonds up to our file a habeas remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow any president and his family if in the last few minds your white house reporters and photographers have been an been attending church services with regularity when a purely gonna know bob how on the other hand i realize that your stepson wire service photographers may be complaining that they do not enjoy the same green for religious the local golf courses which they want am which is true that my predecessor did not object beside you two pages of one of golfing scale in action and either on the other hand vienna venus secret service man why our topic tonight is a more so why are concerned about which is as well as evidence i wanna talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger the events of recent weeks may i help to a low monday that challenge for south of the dimensions of its threat level lodge in the horizon for many years whenever i hoped maybe for the future for using this threat on living when it there's no escaping either the gravity all the totality of his challenge to our survival and was security the challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every spirit human activity this deadly challenge imposes upon our society to require months of direct concern both to the press and the president to requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone but which must be reconciled and full sail if we are to meet this national peril by reserves heiress to the need for far greater public information and second to the needs of far greater official secrecy the very word secrecy is read by them in a free and open society and we are sick people inherently and his dark opposed to secret societies to see ghosts and as he could perceive things we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and anwar added concealment of pregnant facts far outweigh the dangers we just cited to justify even today there is no value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating it's arbitrary restrictions even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if i conditions do not survive with it and there is very great danger that unannounced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of officials censorship and concealment that i do not intend to permit the extent that it's in my control and north issue of my administration weather is ranked is high on all civilian i'm military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to sense of the news to stifle dissent to cover up on the state will withhold from the press and public the fact they deserve to know but i do ask the tough but i do ask every publisher every ended up in every newsman the nation to re examine his own standards and recognize the nature of our countries there are in time of war the government and the press have customarily drawing in an asset based largely on self discipline to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy in times of player and present danger the courts upheld that even the privilege rights of the first amendment must yield to the public's need for national security today no war has been declared an hour must say as the struggle maybe it may never be declared in the traditional fashion our way of life is under attack those who make themselves our enemy are dancing around the globe the survival of our friends he's in danger and yet no wars been declared no borders have been crossed by marching through which no missiles have been five years the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self discipline of combat conditions but i can only say that no wallet have abolished the greatest threat to our security if you are awaiting a finding of clear and present danger than i can only say the danger has never been more the up and it's presence has never been more imminent it requires a change in our walk a change in tactics they change admissions by the government by the people by every businessman or labor leader and by every newspaper all we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on how that means they're expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on severity instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of bombing by day is a system which has been scripted banned human and material resources into the building of a tightening it highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations its preparations are concealed not published its mistakes of bury my headline it's descent is a silence that phrase no expenditures question no rumors they know she quit is revealed the conducts the cold war in show up with a wartime discipline no democracy would have a hope all wish to match nevertheless every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints on national security on the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are will close this kind of attack as well as outright invasion of the facts of the matter ah that this nation's voters have openly boasted of acquiring salon newspapers information they would otherwise higher agents to apply to theft bribery or espionage that details of this nation's by the preparations the county enemies have an operation to have been available to every newspaper reader friend and foe alike that the size the strength the location and the nature of our forces and weapons and our plans and strategy for the use of all been employed in the press and other news media three degrees sufficient to satisfy any foreign power and ended at least one case the publication of the cherubs concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed requires all ration of the expense of considerable time and money the newspapers which printed the stories were loyal patriotic responsible well meaning but we've been engaged open warfare they undoubtedly would not publish such items but in the absence of open warfare they recognized only the test of journalism and not the sense of national security and my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted that question is do you own the land no public official should answer it for you know got a memo plan should impose its restraints against your will but i would be failing in my duty to the nation and considering all of the responsibilities that we now they are and all of the means at hand to meet those responsibilities if i did not commanded this problem to your attention energy thoughtful consideration and many earlier occasions i've said in your newspapers have constantly said that the sun times and appeal to every citizen sense of sacrifice and self discipline they call out to every citizen the way his rights and comforts against his obligations to the common good i cannot now believe that those citizens who serve in the newspaper business consider themselves exam from that appeal have no intention of establishing a new officer more information to govern the flow of news i'm not suggesting any new forms of censorship on nuke types of security classification i'm no easy answer to the dilemma that i've polished and would not seek to impose it if i had won but i am asking the members of the newspaper for fresh and the industry in this country to reexamine their all responsibilities to consider the degree of the nature of the present danger and indeed the beauty of self restraint which that danger imposes upon us all every newspaper now as itself with respect to every story is it moves all i suggest is that you wear the question is it in the address on national security and i hope every group in america unions in businessman in public officials at every level or less the same question of their endeavors and so did their actions to this same exact test injured the press of america and said aaron recommended the voluntary assumption of specific new steps on machinery i can assure you that we will cooperate all caught up with those recommendations that they will be no recommendations fact there's no answer to the dilemma faced by a free and open society in a cold and he could walk in times of peace any discussion of this subject and any action that results of both painful and without president but this is a time of peace and peril which knows no president in history is the young president nature of this challenge but also give rise to your second obligation to navigation which i share and that is our obligation to windfall panel are the american people to make sure that they possess all the fact that they need an honest venomous well the perils of prospects the purposes of our program and the choices that we face though president should say of public scrutiny of his program for from next move me come to understand and from that understanding and support or opposition and both unnecessary i'm not asking your newspapers to support an administration but i am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing them alerting the american people for i have complete thousand f. when the response and education of our citizens whenever they are fully informed on not only could not stifle controversy among your readers i welcome this administration intends to be candid about sarah's further wise man once they're in arid doesn't become a mistake on to you refuse to correct it we intend to except for responsibility for our arrows and we expect you to point them out when we missed without debate without criticism no administration in no country can succeed and no republican survive that is why the athenian law makers so he created a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy and that is why are crashed with protected by the first demand the only business in america specifically protected by the constitution not primarily to amuse and entertain not to emphasize that video and sentimental not to simply give the public would want but to involve bois ramos to reflect the state are dangers and our opportunities to indicate on crises and our choices to leave mall educate and sometimes even anger public opinion this means great coverage an analysis of international moved far is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local it means greater attention to improve understanding of the news as well as improved transmission which means filing the government at all levels must meet its obligations to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrow as limits on national security and we intend to do with it was
